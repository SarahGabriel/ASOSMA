**Table of Contents**

* [VIDEO.JS - HTML5 Video Player]()

##	Introduction
Video.js is a web video player built from the ground up for an HTML5 world. It supports HTML5 and Flash video, as well as YouTube and Vimeo (through plugins). It supports video playback on desktops and mobile devices. This project was started mid 2010, and the player is now used on over 200,000 websites

Using Video for Everybody as the embed code means you know itâ€™s compatible with many devices (including ones without javascript).
The javascript library fixes browser & device bugs, and makes sure your video is even more compatible across different browser versions.
The pure HTML5/CSS skin ensures a consistent look between HTML5 browsers, and easy custom skinning if you want to give it a specific look, or brand it with your own colors. See the skins page for examples of custom skins.
Free & Open Source
Lightweight. NO IMAGES USED
100% skinnable using CSS
Library independent
Easy to use
Easy to understand & extend
Consistent look between browsers
Full Screen & Full Window Modes
Volume Control
Forced fallback to Flash (even when there is an unsupported source)

### Context Diagram
## Development Process
There is no too much information about the process but from the github record we can learn that the project start with only one developer  and now the project is been developed by a lot of active developers.
The bigger part of this project is the UI part.

VideoJS is an HTML5 Video Player with 3 core parts:

 - An embed code (Video for Everybody),
 - Javascript library (video.js)
 - Pure HTML/CSS skin (video-js.css).

The Javascript library (video.js) section is divided in 7 principal sections:

 - Control-Bar -- All the types of controls (i.e. Audio, Progress, Volume)
 - Menu -- All the menu components (i.e Buttons, Items)
 - Popup -- The Popup component is used to build pop up controls
 - Slider -- The base functionality for sliders like the volume bar and seek bar
 - Tech -- Module for media (HTML5 Video, Flash) controllers
 - Tracks -- Setup the common parts of an audio, video, or text track
 - Utils -- Various utilities

      function resizeVideoJS(){
        var width = document.getElementById(id).parentElement.offsetWidth;
        myPlayer.width(width).height( width * aspectRatio );
      }
