## Describe the model of the development process:
This is an open source project and I would love for there to be a community of volunteers around OptiKey. I have a list the length of my arm with ideas, features and improvements. Here's a sample;

Add support for more languages (dictionaries, as well as localising OptiKey)
Add next word suggestions
Support for accessible buttons, sip/puff tubes, brain potential detection, and lots of other human interfaces
and lots more...
