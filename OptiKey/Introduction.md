# OptiKey

OptiKey is an assistive on-screen keyboard which runs on Windows. It is designed to be used with an eye-tracking device to bring keyboard control, mouse control and speech to people with motor and speech limitations, such as people living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease (MND).

It works out of the box once you have your eye-tracking device installed and allows selections to be made using dwell selection, buttons, etc. If you do not have an eye tracking device you can use OptiKey with a mouse.

OptiKey was written to challenge the outrageously expensive, unreliable and difficult to use AAC (alternative and augmentative communication) products on the market. It is, therefore, fully open-source and free. Forever.

## project fit for our book (or why it was chosen?) 
As a team we decided to choose a small and smart startup with social contribute and has a massive support from people around the web. This project appears to help people with disabilities and have a good cause and we liked it.
It also appears to be a promising project which have a great future in the startup industry and health industry .

## Describe the model of the development process:
This is an open source project and I would love for there to be a community of volunteers around OptiKey. I have a list the length of my arm with ideas, features and improvements. Here's a sample;

Add support for more languages (dictionaries, as well as localising OptiKey)
Add next word suggestions
Support for accessible buttons, sip/puff tubes, brain potential detection, and lots of other human interfaces
and lots more...
