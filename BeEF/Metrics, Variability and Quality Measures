#### Metric tools
Describe the applicability of a design metric tool (e.g. CodeClimate, CodeBeat) to the project code.

Code Climate in an open and extensible static analysis platform. Code Climate monitors the health of the code, from the command line to the cloud, 
so issues can be fixed sooner and ship better code, faster.
It get automated code review for test coverage, complexity, duplication, security, style, and more, and merge with confidence.
